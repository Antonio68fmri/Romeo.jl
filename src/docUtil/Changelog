    Adding functionality: camera movement in one subscreen follows a different
	 subscreen (identical); can we do this with a rotation offset?

    Adding interface to effect geometrical (and possibly other) transformations
	on RenderObject or their presentation by OGL.
	Using 2 techniques: 
	    -camera (in Screen...)
	    -RenderObject (added field manipVirtuals ... not used at the moment)
	Currently works for cube(own RO construction), plot of 2D 
	function ( as provided  with Romeo).

	Issues: Problem when trying to visualize plot of 3D data field (
	        error in renderloop)

    Modularized RomeoLib
    SubsScreens reimplemented for hierachical subscreen model, 
        previous version now called SimpleSubScreens. Additional functionality
        and extensible framework (attrib in SubScreens permit to add various
        set up operations; will try to implement first (not for this commit):
           - shared view parameters between subscreens (dynamic, one view follows the other)
           - derived view parameters (static):subscreen shows a fix view of other subscreen
           - derived view parameters (dynamic√†
           - time dependent display

    Relies on several mods by Sdanisch <sdanisch@gmail.com> (Romeo, GLXX..)
    Operate in Julia 0.3 and 0.4
    Subscreen grid implemented
    RomeoLib  now incorporates standardized procedures, will evolve into library
    RomeoLib moves to src/docUtil

Date:   Sat Mar 14 18:12:53 2015 +0100
    Added signal's library (facilitate use of Reactive)

Date:   Thu Mar 5 14:37:58 2015 +0100
    Added DocCompat package, so that @doc may be used with versions 0.3 (discard doc)
    and 0.4(full function)
